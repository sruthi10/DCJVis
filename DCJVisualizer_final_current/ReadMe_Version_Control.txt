UniMoG-Sources:
intially source code for DCJ operations --> small GUI

UniMoG-Sources_ July 27: (use this to intially check how the graph will be )
Modification to MainFrame.java to input test files rather then input from GUI. then update the graphic based on genome1 and genome 2 files
The path of source and target genome file hardcoded ( MainFrame.java --> line 790). Also, When GUI open just click run 
This is useful to check with our input and Graphic display of UniMoG-Sources code 

Input --> examples/test1 and test2 (fasta file)
try the other fasta files test2c and test1c, and the real input c.albicans and s.cervisiae


DCJ-7301:
Code modified by passing parameters to MainFrame(DCJ Bibserver) 
Outpufile creation
Output Parser --> just error in step intiatlizes --> null because not object is associtated with it. 

DCJVisualizer:

modified and created Dcjvisualizer apart from GCview code
DCJ not incroported yet

DCJVisualizer_combined:
Combined both DCJ + visualizer(GCview) 


Check the DCJ_Test (10/17/2016)
compared copies of code from 8-8-16, 8-15-16,8-16-16.
And adjust 8-15-16 which now gives the correct target and source genome graphs for initial( from text file) and step 0 (from DCJ operation). 

In the main folder of BOX:
Final_Version_DCJ_ 8_15_16 (in netbeans shown as DCJVisualizer_final_8_15_16) this folder will have update from this point on.

There is additional copy till this step under C:\Users\sxc105920\Box Sync\BioInformatics Research\Versions_ DCJ _Visualizer\DCJ_Test\Final_Version_DCJ_ 8_15_16
