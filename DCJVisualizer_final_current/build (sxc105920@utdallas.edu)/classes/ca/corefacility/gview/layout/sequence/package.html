Provides for methods to use to layout and position any items along the sequence, and dividing up the map into different slots.

<p>Implementing classes here can be used to create a new layout.  The important classes here are Backbone, SequencePath, LayoutFactory, and SlotRegion.</p>
<p>Backbone is used to provide a way to translate points from cartesian coordinates (x,y) to coordinates on a sequence (base, height from center backbone ribbon).</p>
<p>SequencePath is used to translate not just points, but curves from cartesian coordinates to sequence coordinates.  It is styled similar to the Java Path2D.
It constructs curves out of segments provided gview.layout.prototype.segments.  These segments store the curve in terms of sequence coordinates, so that when zooming,
a new "stretched" curve can be constructed.</p>
<p>SlotRegion is simply used to store and provide access to all the layout-specific objects.  It is created with a LayoutFactory implementation.</p>
<p>LayoutFactory is used to construct all the objects for a particular layout.  It will construct the Backbone object, as well as the SequencePath objects.</p>
